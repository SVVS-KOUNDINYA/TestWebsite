        I am SVVS KOUNDINYA, I am from India and am learning Webb Development from Udemy. Working in AWS in a customer facing role which is scary but also exciting. Got a lot out of life and am expecting much more. Aslo being humble is overrated.

    <p>This part is where I test the Un Ordered lists</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This is list item 1</li>
        <li>This is list item 2</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This is a sub list in item 2 from before</li>
            <li>Yet another sub list in item 2 from before</li>
            <ul>
                <li> Guess this has now become a nested list, I'm sooo good</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
